To develop a website for data science, we'll need to consider the following resources:

1. **Budget**: A moderate to high budget will be required, depending on the scope and complexity of the project. Let's assume a budget of $100,000 to $200,000.

2. **Tools**:
	* Front-end development: React, Angular, or Vue.js
	* Back-end development: Python (with Flask or Django), Node.js
	* Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB
	* Data analysis and visualization: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
	* Cloud platform: AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure

3. **Storage**: We'll need a reliable storage solution to store and process large datasets. This can be achieved through:
	* Cloud-based storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
	* Database-as-a-service (DBaaS) solutions like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure Database Services

Considering the available skills, we have:
* Vivek (Python, SQL, Data Analysis) can handle back-end development and data analysis tasks.
* Akshit (Web Development, JavaScript) can handle front-end development tasks.
* Vaibhav (Cloud Computing, DevOps) can handle cloud infrastructure and DevOps tasks.

However, we're missing some essential skills:
* **Data Science**: We need an expert in machine learning, deep learning, and data modeling to develop predictive models and data-driven insights.
* **Data Engineering**: We need someone with expertise in data warehousing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and data pipelines to design and implement a robust data architecture.

To fill these gaps, I recommend hiring:
* A **Data Scientist** with expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data modeling (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* A **Data Engineer** with expertise in data warehousing, ETL, and data pipelines (e.g., Apache Beam, Apache Spark)

Additionally, we can utilize the existing skills:
* Ansh (Project Management) can oversee the project and ensure timely completion.
* Vivek Choudhary (Team Leadership, Strategic Planning) can provide strategic guidance and leadership.
* John Doe (UI/UX Design, Graphic Design) can create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
* Ishani (Digital Marketing, SEO) can help promote the website and improve its online visibility.

Mohit (Mobile Development, Flutter) is not directly relevant to this project, as we're focusing on web development. However, their skills can be useful if we decide to develop a mobile app in the future.

With the right combination of skills and resources, we can develop a robust and efficient website for data science that provides valuable insights and predictive models.
