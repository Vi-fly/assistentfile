To create a website for your company, you'll need the following resources:

1. **Budget**: A minimum budget of $5,000 to $10,000 is recommended, depending on the complexity and scope of the project. This will cover the costs of:
	* Domain registration and web hosting
	* Design and development tools
	* Employee salaries or freelance fees
	* Testing and debugging
2. **Tools**:
	* Web development framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js)
	* Front-end development tools (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
	* Back-end development tools (e.g., Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django)
	* Database management system (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
	* Version control system (e.g., Git)
	* Project management tools (e.g., Asana, Trello, Jira)
3. **Storage**:
	* Web hosting service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)
	* Cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)

As for the team, you have a good mix of skills, but some roles are missing. Here's a suggested team composition:

1. **Project Manager**: Ansh (Project Management)
2. **Web Developer**: Akshit (Web Development, JavaScript) and Tejas (Web Development)
3. **Front-end Developer**: Bhavya (Frontend Development, Graphic Designing)
4. **Back-end Developer**: Sahil Repuriya (Full Stack developer) or Vivek (Python, SQL, Data Analysis)
5. **UI/UX Designer**: John Doe (UI/UX Design, Graphic Design)
6. **Digital Marketing Specialist**: Ishani (Digital Marketing, SEO)

You're missing a:
1. **Quality Assurance (QA) Tester**: to ensure the website is thoroughly tested and debugged.
2. **DevOps Engineer**: to handle cloud computing, deployment, and maintenance. Vaibhav (Cloud Computing, DevOps) can handle this role, but it's essential to have a dedicated DevOps engineer.
3. **Content Writer**: to create engaging content for the website.

To fill these gaps, consider hiring:
1. A QA tester with experience in testing web applications.
2. A DevOps engineer with expertise in cloud computing, deployment, and maintenance.
3. A content writer with experience in writing engaging content for websites.

The other employees, such as Vivek Choudhary (Team Leadership, Strategic Planning), Mohit (Mobile Development, Flutter), Priyanshu (Langchain, Langgraph, ML, DL, Transformer, Agentic ai, RAG), Jane (C), Prateek (Python), Raj Prasad Ambavane (Machine Learning, Python, AI), and Prerna (Cooking), may not be directly involved in the web development process, but they can contribute to other aspects of the project or future initiatives.
